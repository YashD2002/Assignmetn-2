# Python Tasks

This repository contains two basic Python programs for practice:

## Task 1 - Even or Odd Checker
This script prompts the user to enter an integer, then checks whether it is even or odd using an `if-else` statement.

**File:** `task1.py`

## Task 2 - Sum of Numbers
This script calculates the sum of integers from 1 to 50 and displays the result.

**File:** `task2.py`
